Algorithm:

1- Each image has its seperate template and threshold.
2- Apply template matching.
3- Use a sliding window to get the local Maximums.
4- The local maximums with value larger than threshold are detected as sushi pieces
5- Remove unnecessary detections by removing pieces that are too close to each other.
